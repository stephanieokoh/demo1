This is my final assignment for Software Engineering

Here we have a special type of chess game in which all the rows are applicable, but you have to decide among all.

So, we use a 2D matrix for the board of the game and properly carried out the deletions.
There are many rules like we have a function named isKing_Attached or not. These functions help us in decision-making of other instructions.



At the end of the program we have stored the data of the Player in the file and then read it from the file.
